It has been years since I wanted to build a personal website. But I finally got down to doing it during this time when I was graduating and writing my thesis. [Github Pages][Github Pages] + [Jekyll][Jekyll] provides a convenient and elegant way to build it. It makes posting an article/blog as simple as making a `Git commit`. During this process, I've also learned a bit about the powerful tools - `HTML`, `CSS`, and `JavaScript`, which are intriguing. Hope to know more about them!

I'd love to express my gratitude to [Hux's blog][Hux's blog], a wonderful open-source project where my website is adapted. Apart from basic functions, it allows several extra great features such as searching and adding tags.
