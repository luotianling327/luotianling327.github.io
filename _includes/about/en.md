##### About me

Hi, I am Tianling, a master's student at the [University of Chicago](https://www.uchicago.edu/) studying economics. Prior to UChicago, I obtained my Bachelor of Science in Mathematics from the [University of Hong Kong](https://www.hku.hk/) (with a double major in economics and a minor in computer science).

##### Research

My academic research interests include game theory and mechanism design. I'm currently working on my master thesis *School Choice with Reserved Seats* about matching theory in economics. I also wrote an economics paper *Punishment Designs on Revolution* during my undergraduate study at HKU, focusing on game theory, information structure, and macroeconomics.

Besides, I'm passionate about machine learning and NLP. I have researched with mathematics, finance, and computer science professors on projects involving deep learning, sentiment analysis, and supervised learning, respectively.

##### Experience

I am now an Applied Data Fellow at the University of Chicago, Harris School of Public Policy, ready to become a data scientist for a social impact-oriented organization.

In the past, I interned in several financial institutions in Hong Kong and mainland China, including an investment bank, an asset management company, and a securities company. I was a Teaching Assistant in Computer Programming (Python) at HKU and an academic tutor in mathematics and statistics at UChicago. I was a Research Assistant for a few professors as mentioned above.
